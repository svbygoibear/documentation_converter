# Documentation Converter

## Intro
 This converter is intended as an aid when creating the much needed documentation here at Full Facing. Currently this app only uses text files as input, but feel free to add a simple UI if you feel it would fit better.
 Keep in mind this can only (for now) be used to change standard wiki docs to swagger. (Feel free to add more things)

## What this application does:
- [x] Converts standard wiki documentation to swagger samples
- [ ] Creates complete swagger definition
- [ ] Converts swagger to wiki documentation
- [ ] Converts case classes to wiki documentation
